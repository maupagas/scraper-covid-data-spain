# PDF Scraper to get Epidemiological Data from Spain for COVID-19

The tool stored consists of an RMarkdown code that was used in 2021 to extract epidemiological data from periodically published reports for the COVID-19 pandemic.

By executing the code, the table(s) desired can be extracted, modified and saved into a spreadsheet for future use. 

In this case, it was used to extract data that was used in the Epidemiological model developed [this repository](https://github.com/EnvBioProM/COVID_Model) that resulted in [this article in PLOS One](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248243).
