# PDF Scraper to get Epidemiological Data from Spain for COVID-19

The tool stored consists of an RMarkdown code that was used in 2021 to extract epidemiological data from periodically published reports for the COVID-19 pandemic.

By executing the code, the table(s) desired can be extracted, modified and saved into a spreadsheed for future use. 

In this case, it was used to extract data to the Epidemiological model used in [this repository](https://github.com/EnvBioProM/COVID_Model).
